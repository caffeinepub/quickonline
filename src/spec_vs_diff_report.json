However, some requirements/non-goals are violated: Footer copyright text doesn’t match the required “QuickOnline © 2026” string, additional unrequested authentication hooks/providers were added, pricing copy includes admin-panel/order-management features (explicitly non-goals), and additional dominant accent colors (green/yellow/red) are introduced.",
