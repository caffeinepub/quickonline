# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a clean, premium, single-page “QuickOnline” landing page that convinces shopkeepers to get a website.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a single-page layout with sections in order: Hero, Benefits, Pricing (3 packages), Testimonials, Contact (WhatsApp + Call + form), Footer.
- Apply a cohesive premium theme: white background, blue/black accents, bold modern typography, subtle shadows, smooth subtle animations, and full mobile responsiveness.
- Implement Hero copy with a prominent primary CTA and at least one trust element above the fold.
- Implement Pricing with exactly 3 package cards (Basic, Standard, Premium), inclusions list, and a CTA per package (optionally highlight a recommended plan).
- Implement Testimonials with at least 3 testimonial entries.
- Implement Contact actions: WhatsApp link (wa.me), Call link (tel:), and a simple contact form with client-side validation and a clear success state (no backend).
- Add generated brand visuals as static assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and place them in the hero/header and/or footer.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can scroll a premium QuickOnline landing page on mobile/desktop, review benefits/pricing/testimonials, and contact via WhatsApp, phone call, or submit a validated contact form with a visible confirmation.
